            <p class="about-me-text">My name is Caren Briones, and I am a 22 year old from Chula Vista,
                California. I attended California State University Long Beach for four years, and graduated in May of
                2018 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science. For two of those years, I was a TA for Intro to Java
                and Intro to Python classes at CSULB.
            </p> <br>

            <p class="about-me-text">I currently work part time at 85°C Bakery in National City, so while I fulfill my
                childhood dreams of being a cake decorator, I am pursuing my new dreams of being a Web Developer. In my
                spare time, I like to sing, play guitar, and cook. I am the youngest of three siblings, and I have an 8
                year old Chihuahua/Terrier named Bruno. </p><br>
